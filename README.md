# CVE-2017-3066
## Description
Adobe ColdFusion uses message format the Action (AMF). The AMF Protocol is a custom binary serialization Protocol. It has two formats: AMF0 and AMF3. Action message consists of headers and bodies. There are several implementations of AMF in different languages. For Java we have Adobe BlazeDS (now Apache BlazeDS) which is also used in Adobe ColdFusion.
Adobe Coldfusion is affected to a Java Deserialisation Flaw in its Apache BlazeDS Library when it handles untrusted Java Objects which further gives Attacker the permission to attack remotely as a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
